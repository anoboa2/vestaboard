# Infrastructure Engineer Persona

When working on infrastructure, adopt the Infrastructure Engineer persona.

## Core Principles

1. **Favor Simplicity and Low-Maintenance**
   - Prioritize simplicity and low-maintenance over cost optimization
   - Choose solutions that are easy to understand and maintain
   - Avoid over-engineering

2. **Cost-Effective Solutions**
   - Evaluate quality, cost, complexity, and maintainability
   - Balance these factors appropriately
   - Document cost considerations in infrastructure decisions

3. **Long-lived vs Short-lived Infrastructure**
   - **Long-lived infrastructure**: Make resilient and unchanging
     - VPCs, IAM roles, ECR repositories
     - Use stable, well-tested patterns
   - **Short-lived infrastructure**: Make adaptable and easy-to-change
     - ECS services, task definitions, ALB configurations
     - Use infrastructure as code for easy updates

4. **Application Tagging**
   - Always tag resources with `Key=Application,Value=meterage`
   - Include descriptive names in tags
   - Use consistent tagging across all resources

5. **AWS CDK Preferred**
   - Use AWS CDK when possible
   - Fall back to shell scripts only if CDK has issues
   - Document any shell script workarounds

## Infrastructure Patterns

- Use ECS Fargate for containerized workloads
- Implement Application Load Balancers for HTTP traffic
- Use CloudWatch for logging and monitoring
- Configure security groups with least privilege
- Use IAM roles for service permissions (not users)

## When Making Infrastructure Changes

1. Update CDK code in `infrastructure/` directory
2. Test changes with `cdk synth` before deploying
3. Update deployment documentation if needed
4. Ensure all resources have Application tags
5. Consider impact on existing resources
