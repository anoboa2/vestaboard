# Documentation Organization

All project documentation must be organized in the `docs/` folder at the project root.

## Folder Structure

```
docs/
├── features/        # Feature-specific documentation
├── guides/          # How-to guides and architecture docs
├── backlog/         # Future work and bug tracking
├── changelog.md     # Project changelog
├── project-status.md
└── project-summary.md
```

## Features Folder (`docs/features/`)

When starting work on a new feature:

1. **Create a feature folder** with kebab-case naming: `docs/features/<feature-name>/`
2. **Create standard documents** within the feature folder:
   - `planning.md` - Initial planning, requirements, and design decisions
   - `progress.md` - Ongoing progress updates during development
   - `status.md` - Current implementation status and next steps
   - `summary.md` - High-level summary of the feature
   - `completion.md` - Final completion summary and what was delivered

Example:
```
docs/features/user-authentication/
├── planning.md
├── progress.md
├── status.md
├── summary.md
└── completion.md
```

**When to create feature docs:**
- At the start of any new feature development
- When planning a significant change or addition
- When implementing a user-facing capability

**Document naming:**
- Use lowercase with hyphens for folder names (kebab-case)
- Use standard filenames: `planning.md`, `progress.md`, `status.md`, `summary.md`, `completion.md`
- Additional docs can be added as needed (e.g., `backend-completion.md`, `frontend-completion.md`)

## Guides Folder (`docs/guides/`)

Continuously updated documentation about different sections and services of the project.

**Standard guides to maintain:**
- `getting-started.md` - Initial setup and installation
- `backend-architecture.md` - Backend services, structure, and patterns
- `frontend-architecture.md` - Frontend components and patterns
- `game-engine.md` - Game logic and mechanics
- `api-reference.md` - API endpoints and usage
- `testing.md` - Testing infrastructure and best practices
- `quick-start-gameplay.md` - Quick start for gameplay features

**When to update guides:**
- After implementing a new feature that affects architecture
- When adding new API endpoints
- When changing project structure
- When adding new testing patterns
- Whenever project knowledge should be captured for team reference

## Backlog Folder (`docs/backlog/`)

A parking lot for future work and bug tracking.

**Document types:**
- `feature-<name>.md` - Proposed features not yet started
- `bug-<description>.md` - Known bugs captured for future resolution
- `enhancement-<name>.md` - Ideas for improvements

Example:
```
docs/backlog/
├── feature-mobile-app.md
├── feature-tournament-system.md
├── bug-websocket-reconnection.md
└── enhancement-card-animations.md
```

**When to create backlog docs:**
- When a feature idea is discussed but not ready to implement
- When bugs are discovered but can't be fixed immediately
- When enhancement ideas are proposed

## Changelog (`docs/changelog.md`)

The changelog MUST be updated whenever a feature is completed.

**Format:**
```markdown
## [Date] - Feature Name

### Added
- List of new features or capabilities

### Changed
- List of changes to existing functionality

### Fixed
- List of bug fixes

### Technical Details
- Key technical decisions or changes
- Files affected
- Database migrations
```

**When to update:**
- Immediately after completing a feature
- When merging significant changes to main branch
- After fixing important bugs

## Planning Considerations

When Cursor performs planning for new work:

1. **Check existing documentation** in `docs/features/` for related work
2. **Consider which guides** in `docs/guides/` need updating
3. **Create feature folder** at planning time, starting with `planning.md`
4. **Update changelog** when work is complete
5. **Move or create backlog items** for related future work

##File Organization Rules

**DO:**
- Put all documentation in `docs/` folder
- Create feature folders for each new feature
- Update guides when architecture changes
- Update changelog for every completed feature
- Use descriptive, kebab-case folder names
- Keep feature docs together in their folder
- Remove markdown document from `docs/backlog/` if it has been captured in `docs/features/`

**DON'T:**
- Create markdown files in the project root (except README.md)
- Mix feature documentation across multiple folders
- Forget to update the changelog
- Create one-off documentation without a clear category
- Use spaces or special characters in folder names
